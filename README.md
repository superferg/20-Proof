Card Game


Developed using SharpDevelop 5.0, a free open-source IDE.
Visual Studio should work as well.

To play the game, first run the CardGamesServer.exe application and click Start.

Then run the CardGames.exe application.  Go to File->Connect, type in your name and the IP address of the server.  
This can be:
    - the external IP address
    - the local network IP address of the computer if the server is running on the same network
    - the loopback address 127.0.0.1 if you are running the server and game on the same computer

In order to connect using your external IP address, you must set up your router to forward port 4994 to whatever computer is running the server.    
You can run multiple copies of the game on the same computer.  4 players are required.
